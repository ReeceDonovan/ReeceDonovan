# About Me

Hello, I'm Reece Donovan. I graduated with a [BSc (Hons) in Computer Science](https://www.ucc.ie/en/ck401/) from [University College Cork (UCC)](https://www.ucc.ie/en/discover/), where I was deeply involved with [UCC Netsoc](https://netsoc.co/rk/). I began my journey there as a Systems Administrator in June 2021, progressing to the role of Head Systems Administrator in May 2022, a position I held until I concluded my studies at UCC in June 2023. These positions allowed me to apply and expand my knowledge in system design and project management, paralleling my academic pursuits throughout the completion of my degree.

A few months after starting as a Systems Administrator, I joined [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/careers/product-ux-engineering) in early 2022 as a Software Engineer Intern. My dedication and skills led to a transition into a full-time Software Engineer role within a few months, where I remained until 2024. At [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/careers/product-ux-engineering), I was part of a team focused on developing and improving software solutions, gaining comprehensive experience in software development and contributing to impactful projects.

I'm enthusiastic about using my technical skills to work on innovative projects and positively contribute to the field of computer science.
